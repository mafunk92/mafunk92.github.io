# Total Newb
I will attempt to share my experience as I develop as a Software Developer. As I work in a .Net shop most of the experiences will be with C# and web development.

My goals are to dive into the MEAN stack focusing on Angular 2 and also trying out electron for applications. I will try to post at least once a week at a minimum sharing what I learned that week. I dive into web development on my free time as it is different from what I do at work. I want to try and build applications that will integrate what I have learned in my business curriculum during my undergrad.
