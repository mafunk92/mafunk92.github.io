 I will use this site to blog my adventures into web development. I have recently graduated from California State University Stanislaus with a  B.S. in Business Administration with a concentration of Accounting and a minor in Computer Science. I am filling up my free time with applying to jobs and learning about the web.

 I have just recently finished up some of the courses at codeacademy.com and did a face lift to a local Taco Bell franchise which can be found at mafunk92.github.io/ocat. I am also trying to download Yosemite OS X to build a hackintosh as I am  not too pleased with coding on Windows.
