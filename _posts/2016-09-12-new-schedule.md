# Sorry, Not Sorry

It has been awhile since I have been active on giving back; I have been busy with work, and honestly a little fed up with the Angular release candidate. I gave it time to mature but every new iteration just ended up causing breaking changes. This can lead to a big challenge, one that is hard to back away from. But,  I a have limited time to try and learn something after putting in a full day's of work in and trying to learn and trouble shoot problems. After talking to a coworker in another team it got me looking into React.js. I still have the goals of turning what I do for budgeting and inventory management with excel into a web app; I also want to try and create a business dashboard app trying to include majority of what I did during my business curriculum.

Some have said it takes about a month to create a new habit. So now I am going to try and create a schedule that is flexable to create this new habbit of learning web applications. I have also bough 3 courses at Udemy to help accomplish this. I figure with spending money causes me to have skin in the game and I do not want to waste money. I also still need to read my books on coding and continue reading and expanding my vernacular to greater ends.

Hopefully this schedule is enough for me to relax, and flexible enough for me to stick to it. Ever since I have attended Cal Hacks in Fall 2015 I have been interested in web applications and single page applications mainly focusing on angular at the time. As of now I plan on doing a daily blog recapping what I have read and what I have learned from that days post work journey.

After going through my Udemy courses, online tutorials, and business applications; I will focus on switching this site over to react with markdown management like jeklyll.
