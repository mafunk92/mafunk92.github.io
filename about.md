I am a recent graduate from California State University Stanislaus where I
received a B.S. in Business Administration concentration in Accounting and
a minor in Computer Science. In the next coming months I will be starting
my studying regiment for the CPA exam.

My interests are:
<ul>
<li>Technology</li>
<li>Photography</li>
<li>Automobiles</li>
<li>Hiking</li>
<li>Swimming & Water Polo</li>
</ul>

I will be using this site to document my adventures through learning web development
subjects. So far I'm looking at learning Node.js and Angular.
