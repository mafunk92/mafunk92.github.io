 Just got this site up and running following [Josh](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) to make some tweeks to the setup.

 I have just recently finished up some of the courses at codeacademy.com and did a face lift to a local Taco Bell franchise which can be found at [Ocat Inc](http://mafunk92.github.io/ocat). I am also trying to download Yosemite OS X to build a hackintosh as I am  not too pleased with coding on Windows.
