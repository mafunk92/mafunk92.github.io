Over the past couple of days I have been trying to get Yosemite running on my PC. I was not too happy with the performance on my machine which is a couple years old and the compatibility was iffy. I wanted to try OS X because I prefer developing in a Unix environment so I have defaulted to installing elementary OS. The first things I do are:<insert code snippet table>.

Now that everything is set up I will begin my journey onto the MEAN stack. My goal is to develop a couple of CRUD applications while trying to learn how to use Jasmine for unit tests, Grunt/Gulp for a task runner, and Bower for package manager.

For some reason I'm having trouble getting my custom domain working. It's pointing at an old github page that doesn't even have a repo anymore. I'll continue working on it because seeing mafunk92.guthub.io is getting tiring.

At the same time I am applying towards accounting positions in my area. I enjoy learning new things especially in the development area. Eventually I may develop an accounting tutor like website to merge my two areas of my degree together.
