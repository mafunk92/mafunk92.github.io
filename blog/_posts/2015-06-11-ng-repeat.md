Today I will begin attempting to learn the basics of AngularJS. I am aware that 2.XX will be released in the near future with major changes but many of the tutorials are using 1.XX. I will be looking at the twitter clone tutorial by [Microsoft Virtual Academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh0er2pRcq8) for my first app for the MEAN stack. I have also gotten my hand on some PDFs which may also be of value for learning.
