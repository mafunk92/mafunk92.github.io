Today I will begin attempting to learn the basics of AngularJS. I am aware that 2.XX will be released in the near future with major changes but many of the tutorials are using 1.XX. I will be looking at the twitter clone tutorial by [Microsoft Virtual Academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh0er2pRcq8) for my first app for the MEAN stack. I have also gotten my hand on some PDFs which may also be of value for learning.

Edit(17:00)
I was able to finish the above tutorial and have some edits in mind once a learn a little bit more.
I have also complete[CodeCandy](http://codecandy.io/courses/tinder-for-netflix) which goes over a Netflix watch list by following the tinder style minus the swiping. I am now onto a reddit-esk tutorial at [Thinkster](https://thinkster.io/learn-to-build-realtime-webapps/).
