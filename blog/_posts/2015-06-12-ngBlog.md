I have been going through AngularJS tutorials for the past two days taking breaks for the NBA Finals, GO WARRIORS!, and have just finished up creating an AngularJS blog. It may replace this blog as I'm primarily focusing on learning AngularJS and not jekyll even though sigle page applications aren't that great for SEO. I have the blog to be very basic and will be working on using markdown files for posts to follow the jekyll style.
