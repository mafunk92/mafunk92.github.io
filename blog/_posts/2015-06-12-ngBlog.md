I have been going through AngularJS tutorials for the past two days taking breaks for the NBA Finals, **GO WARRIORS!**, and have just finished up creating an AngularJS blog. It may replace this blog as I'm primarily focusing on learning AngularJS and not jekyll even though sigle page applications aren't that great for SEO. I have the blog to be very basic and will be working on using markdown files for posts to follow the jekyll style.
<br>
**The tool box is growing**<br>
So far I have used:<br>
- **M**ongoDB<br>
- **A**ngularJS<br>
- **E**xpressJS<br>
- **N**odeJS<br>
- Bower
- Grunt<br>
- Yeoman<br>
- Ionic<br>
- Instagram API<br>
<br>
I have also been coming up with ideas for my to practice me new skills out and that will be challenging.<br>
**Ideas:**<br>
- POSI system, like the ones found in restaurants<br>
- Personal Website(started today)<br>
- WoW Auction House shopping cart<br>
